# Command Line README.md Generator 

## Description
This is a command-line application that dynamically generates a professional README.md file from a user's input using the Inquirer package.

### Usage
For this README.md Generator to work:
1. Right click index.js and open the Integrated Terminal.

2. On the command line run the code `node index.js`

3. You will then be prompted by a series of questions for your README.md, when answering these questions please be as descriptive as possible.

4. Once you are done answering your questions you will see a message that states 'Congratulations, you have successfully created a README.md for your project!'. Once you see this message you can look to the left and see a new README.md was created. 

5. You can now take this new README.md and use for your new project!
